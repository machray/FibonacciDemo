This is a Spring Boot application which runs sequence() in order to print to console the fibonacci sequence until it goes past 1 billion.

TODO:

Set values in an array and be able to retrieve the nth number in the sequence. A visual pattern would by nice too. Also by keeping the values in an array, test can be writen.
